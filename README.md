# World CRUD Application - Group Report


## Introduction

The project context and idea was to develop a CRUD application, providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a website to a database on a server. The organisation required reporting on population information. A new system must be designed and implemented to allow easy access to this population information.

---

## Research Question / Problem Being Addressed

View all the countries and cities in the world organised by largest to smallest population.

---

## Aims

Our aim was to create a CRUD application using the `world-db` file provided to us.

---

## Objectives

- Identifying the requirements (functional and non-functional)  
- Prioritising the requirements (if applicable)  
- Task allocation  
- Identifying the scope of the project  
- Identifying the stakeholders  
- Risk management

## Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Considerations

**Legal considerations** – being alert when using code/ideas from the internet. Certain code may be copyrighted and not allowed to be used by other users.  
**Social considerations** – our project may have cultural/political sensitivity. For example, our database has information stating the leader of each country. In countries with civil unrest, there may be disagreement over leadership.  
**Ethical considerations** – ensuring that the world database is accurate and free from bias, including correct representation of country size and territories.  
**Professional considerations** – maintaining professionalism throughout the project, resolving conflicts appropriately, and accepting individual responsibilities.

## Technology Review

The following technologies were used:

- **Node.js** – allows JavaScript to run on a server (web back-end)  
- **Express.js** – handles communication between front-end and back-end  
- **HTML** – used to create web pages
- **Pug** – template engine for Node.js and browser, generates HTML

These tools were essential in fulfilling the project’s requirements.

## Design

Tasks were divided evenly amongst group members over four sprints:

**Sprint 1**:  
- Product backlog  
- Code of conduct  
- GitHub project URL  
- Dockerfile setup  

**Sprint 2**:  
- GitHub issues  
- User stories  
- zube.io integration  
- Kanban and sprint boards  
- Personas, full use cases, use case/class diagrams  

**Sprint 3**:  
- Unit and integration tests (Travis CI/CircleCI)  
- Updated task board  
- Shared GitHub repository  
- Database design and implementation  
- HTML pages using Pug with dynamic content  

**Sprint 4**:  
- Application deployment with docker-compose  
- Bug reporting system  
- Final report and metrics  
- Complete task board and project requirements met

## Evaluation

## Conclusion

A website was created that displays the `world.db` file contents. Countries, cities, and languages are accessible through separate tabs. Users can sort data from highest to lowest or vice versa.

## Reflection

The project was completed on time, with tasks equally divided.
